# Pewdiepie's Tambourine The Game on the Arduboy2

"Floor Gang Ouh"
-Pewdiepie

Here it is, this is a beta edition of a Tambourine Game designed for an Arduino Boy 2 (https://arduboy.com/). My kit was home made for about $10-$20 AUD

I shaped the hand and tambourine in Photoshop (Courtesy to my School) and then used epic gamer nerd code to build a masterpiece of a game
